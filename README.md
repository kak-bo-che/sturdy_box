## A New Parametric Laser Box Design

Laser cut boxes often involve the careful application of acrylic cement, or the awkward tightening of fasteners. After some experience with such boxes, I wanted something better.

The box was originally created in [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org) and later rewritten in OpenJSCAD, so that it could be manipulated on-line.

I'll include a post later on how to customize the box, but you can begin manipulating it directly on the [OpenJSCAD Site](http://openjscad.org/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kak-bo-che/sturdy_box/master/sturdy_box.jscad)
